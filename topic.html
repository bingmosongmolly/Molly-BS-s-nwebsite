      <h2>Why I’m Exploring Learning Analytics</h2>
      <img class="hero-img" src="https://picsum.photos/1200/501" alt="Notebook and laptop representing analytics" />
      <p>
        I’m fascinated by learning analytics—the practice of using data to improve how we
        study and teach. Good analytics doesn’t replace human judgment; it augments it.
        Simple dashboards can reveal whether a study plan is balanced, where time is being
        wasted, and which topics deserve extra attention. I’m starting with lightweight
        tools such as spreadsheets and small JavaScript snippets to track goals, outcomes,
        and reflection notes. The goal isn’t to collect every metric; it’s to capture a few
        signals that lead to better decisions week after week.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach emphasizes transparency and iteration. I regularly review what I
        planned versus what actually happened, write a short summary of what worked, and
        choose one change to test next. Over time, these small adjustments accumulate into
        real progress. I also care about clear visuals: clean typography, generous spacing,
        and minimal color accents make information easier to scan. This site is my sandbox
        for those ideas, and I’ll continue to expand it with examples, notes, and bite-sized
        experiments anyone can try.
